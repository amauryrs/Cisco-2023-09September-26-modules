    "\n",
    "- It's more work to write\n",
    "- It's more of a cognitive load to keep track of\n",
    "- It takes long to execute\n",
    "- It's harder to wrap your mind around it when you're reading someone else's code\n",
    "- If you need to change something, you need to change it in multiple places\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite of DRY code is ... WET code (\"write everything twice\")\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we DRY up our code?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we have the same lines (more or less) several times in a row, we can use a loop.\n",
    "- If we have the same code (more or less) several times in the same program, we can use a function.\n",
    "- If we have the same code (more or less) several times in *different* programs... we can use a *library*. Then we can simply import the library into our program, and make use of that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every language has libraries. Python calls our libraries \"modules,\" and they function not just for DRYing up our code, but also as namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: If I work on a program and call my variable `x`, and you work on a program, and you call your variable `x`, and we want to join these programs together, then Python will ensure (because they're both modules) that the names don't collide and cause chaos."
